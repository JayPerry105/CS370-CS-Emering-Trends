# CS370-CS-Emering-Trends


In this project, I was tasked with creating a "pirate" intelligent agent that uses a deep Q-learning algorithm to navigate a virtual environment and find treasure before the human player. The starter code provided included the environment setup and structure of the game world, which consisted of pathways, obstacles, and treasure locations. The code base defined how the pirate agent and other game elements were represented, but the actual intelligent behavior of the pirate was left for me to implement.

The main portion of code that I created myself revolved around the deep Q-learning algorithm. I implemented the algorithm to allow the pirate agent to learn from its environment by balancing exploration (trying new paths) and exploitation (following known good paths) to efficiently find the treasure. This required coding the agent’s reward mechanism, defining its state and action spaces, and setting up the neural network that sets the framework for the Q-learning approach. I also ensured the algorithm met performance goals and ran without errors.


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design and build systems that solve complex problems across various fields. 
They focus on writing algorithms, developing software, and applying computational theory to create systems that can learn, reason, and make decisions.
Their work matters because it drives innovation in industries such as healthcare, finance, and entertainment, and provides solutions that improve efficiency and capabilities in everyday life.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. I define the problem clearly, identify the constraints, and then devise algorithms or models to address the challenge.
This involves testing, debugging, and iterating on the solution while keeping scalability and maintainability in mind. 
For example, in this project, I started by understanding the pathfinding problem, then applied deep Q-learning to allow the agent to learn how to navigate toward the treasure.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the solutions I design are fair, safe, and respectful of the user’s privacy.
In this case, I had to ensure that the AI pirate agent behaves in a way that is fun and fair for the player. 
More broadly, as AI systems grow more sophisticated, developers must be aware of biases, ensure transparency in decision-making processes,
and prevent unintended harm to users or organizations, particularly in terms of data security and privacy.
